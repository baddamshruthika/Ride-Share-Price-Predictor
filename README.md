# Ride-Share Fare Price Predictor 🚖

A Machine Learning project that predicts the estimated cost of a ride-share trip (like Uber/Lyft) based on key travel factors. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview
* **Goal:** To build a regression model that accurately estimates fare prices.
* **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor.
* **Metric:** R2 Score (coefficient of determination).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy.

## 📊 Key Features
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values using mean imputation.
* **Feature Engineering:** Extracted 'Hour' and 'Weekday' to capture peak-hour pricing surges.
* **Model Performance:** Achieved ~92% accuracy on the test dataset.
